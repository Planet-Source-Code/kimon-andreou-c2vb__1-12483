### Description

C2VB parses through C style declarations of functions, structures etc and creates the VB equivalent.

I decided to create this little program to make my life easier when working with APIs.

Instead of having to "translate" an API declaration from the Platform SDK help file, I wanted a way to do that automatically. This is the result.

All you have to do, is copy paste the declaration from the help file.

Apart from being a handy app. it demonstrates how to parse instructions, how to implement a rudimentary splitter and above all, it explains what do all those wierd things mean in C!

It can process either user inputted instructions or it can read from a file.

Optionally, a filename can be passed on the command line.

If you have any comments or disagree with the way I converted the datatypes, let me know.
